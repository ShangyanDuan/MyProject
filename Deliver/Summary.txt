It can be seen from the above results that the Random Forest Model has the highest accuracy, followed by the Decision Tree and the Logistic Regression. Random Forests is one of the most popular. Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees (n_estimators=100) at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
